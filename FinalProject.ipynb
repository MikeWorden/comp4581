    "# Introduction to Bayesian Thinking\n",
    "Bayesian statistics provide a foundational and intuitive approach to probabilistic reasoning, incorporating prior beliefs and observed evidence to update probability distributions. The key principles include:\n",
    "- __Bayes' Theorem__ - The probability of event A, given that event B has subsequently occurred, is given as\n",
    "Â¬ \n",
    "- __Posterior Distribution:__ Bayesian inference relies on updating beliefs through the posterior distribution, which combines the likelihood of the observed data with the prior distribution. \n",
    "- __Posterior Probability:__  A specific probability derived from the posterior distribution, referring to the probability of a particular event given the observed data.\n",
    "- __Credible Intervals:__ Unlike frequentist confidence intervals, Bayesian credible intervals offer a probability-based interpretation of parameter uncertainty.\n",

    "While Bayesian methods provide a probabilistic framework for inference, that is easily understood.  Consider the following simple example in python (Vishwesh, 2023):\n",
